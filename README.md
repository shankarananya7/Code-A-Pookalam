### Pookalam Description
Small glowing golden dots around the rangoli. Beautiful diamond/star shapes between petals. Glow/shadow effects to make it festive.



### Technologies Used
Created div elements for circles, petals, dots, and diamonds.
Acts as the skeleton of the design.
Colors & gradients → background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow, orange);
Shapes:
Circles → using border-radius: 50%.
Petals → using clip-path: polygon(...).
Diamonds → using transform: rotate(45deg).
Positioning → absolute positioning to place each petal and decoration symmetrically.
Glow Effects → box-shadow to give a glowing rangoli look.
